## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

On first push to my personal GitHub, I have completed chapters 1 - 4 of nextjs.org/learn which has taught me:
1. How use TailWind CSS in my code to style components and how to use plain CSS if preferred 
2. How to incude fonts and images and how Next.js automatically optimizes images inlcuded using the < Image /> component
3. How to create folders in /app to create nested routes that map to a URL segment, and to create the page.tsx file within each folder to serve the React component.
4. How to colocate files that are not public within my folders
5. How to create a layout.tsx file that serves components that will be displayed on each page of the application that is located within the same parent folder as the layout.tsx file

Everything after this has been added as its own commit.
